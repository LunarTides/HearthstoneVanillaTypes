## Hearthstone Types
This is some types for a [Hearthstone Card API](https://hearthstonejson.com) that i use in [Hearthstone.js](https://github.com/LunarTides/Hearthstone.js).
This should be compatible with that api.

The npm package is [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hearthstonejs/vanillatypes)
